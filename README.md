# belly-button-challenge

## Description
* This is the homework challenge for module 14 of bootcamp, which focuses on using HTML to examine a dataset about belly button diversity. The datasest specifies a microbial species, which are called "operational taxonoic units" or OTUs. These OTUs are present in about 70 percent of people, and the rest are pretty rare. 

* There are three main tasks for this assignment; first is a horizontal bar chart, second is a bubble chart and finally demographic information. All three are interactive correspond to a drop down menu found on the page.

## Code
* This challenge was very technical and there were a few topics that warranted further study. Our instructor held a brainstorming session which laid the groundwork for the 'function init()' and the 'function displayCharts(id)' sections of the code. 

* I also needed assistance from BCS on syntax for both the bar and bubble charts. I referenced the plotly javascript documentation throughtout the assignment as well.

* In addition, I had a session with my tutor. During this session, my tutor collaborated with me on the 'function demographics(id, allData)' section. The code that I had prior to the session was close, but the formatting was off. He showed me a few examples of HTML code and I was able to work through to get the results I was looking for. 

* The lessons we learned in class were referenced for nearly every part of the code.
